Write a program that calculates the average grade of a student based on their scores in multiple subjects. The program should ask the user to enter the number of subjects, and then prompt them to enter the score for each subject. Finally, it should calculate and display the average grade. Assume that all subjects have equal weightage.

Example output:
Enter the number of subjects: 4
Enter the score for subject 1: 85
Enter the score for subject 2: 90
Enter the score for subject 3: 92
Enter the score for subject 4: 88

Average grade: 88.75
